Document manager for people with a one-sided printer.
If you have multiple documents to print you don't have to wait by your printer for every document to flip it to its even or odd side. 

SpeedPrinting clubs multiple documents together and adds a blank page in between if necessary so you only have to press print twice and flip the sheets once. (instead of Pressing print 2xN times flipping N times)
